<div class="p">Significant amounts of artifactual material have been found in the fields around the excavated portion of the monastic complex. Surface collections have been made in parts of these fields, especially in the portion directly to the north of the monastic complex. The proportions of material of different periods vary from one part of the site to another, with this field having more early material and less late medieval than other parts of the site, but the range should be generally representative of the site assemblage. Because the surface assemblage included many eroded body sherds that could belong to any of various local fabrics, a higher-than-usual proportion of the fragments are unidentified.</div>
