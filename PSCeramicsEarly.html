However, there is also evidence for earlier, less intensive use of the site, stretching back at least to the early Bronze Age.</P><P>Almost all of this material has been found as small, often eroded fragments redeposited in later contexts, so at present little can be said about the nature of the occupation or use of the site in these earlier periods.</P>

The pottery consists mostly of body sherds, with only a few clearly datable diagnostics. Prehistoric fabrics in this region have not been studied in detail; the wide variety at Psalmodi suggests that closer study may produce useful information. Tempering materials include calcite grit, quartz/mixed grit, calcite and shell, and quartz/mixed sand; surface treatments include plain, burnished, heavily burnished, smudged, and comb-impressed; firing varies from fully oxidized to fully reduced.</P><table border="0"><tr> <td> <a href="images/PS89/PS89.012.001.gif"> <img src="images/PS89/PS89.012.001small.gif" border="2"> </a> </td> <td> <P>The earliest diagnostic piece is a Late Beaker (Epicampaniforme) handle, dating to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2000 BC). This is the only diagnostic piece of pre-Iron Age pottery on the site, but some of the other pieces may also be early, particularly the calcite-and-shell pottery. There is also a flint arrowhead of approximately the same date, and many of the other flint artifacts may be of this period.</P> </td> </tr><tr> <td> <a href="images/PS89/PS89.FF.010.gif"> <img src="images/PS89/PS89.FF.010small.gif" border="2"> </a> </td> <td> <p>Rim of a large jar in a heavily burnished dark gray fabric; probably Iron Age (c. 700 to 50 BC).</p> </td> </tr>
