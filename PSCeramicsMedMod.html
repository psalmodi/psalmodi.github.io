<HTML> <HEAD><TITLE>Medieval and Modern Pottery</TITLE></HEAD> <BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" text="#000000"> <center> <h2>Medieval and Modern Pottery</h2> </center><p>The large and diverse ceramic assemblage at Psalmodi contains an almost continuous sequence from Late Antiquity to the present. Unlike the <A HREF="PSCeramicsLA.html">Late Ancient ceramics</A>, which can mostly be assigned to well-known categories with standard typologies, the study of the medieval and modern ceramics has required creation of a classification system.</p><p>The presentation here makes use of the current version of the Psalmodi classification for medieval and modern pottery, but the classification remains preliminary and subject to major revisions. Statements regarding date and place of origin should likewise be considered possibly subject to revision.</p><p>We are grateful to Claude Raynaud, Marie Leenhardt, and Lucy Vallauri, who have offered advice and allowed us to compare our ceramics to other sites in the region; without their assistance our work would have made much less progress than it has.</p>

The first synthesis to put the study of early medieval pottery in the region on a firm basis was published by the CATHMA group in 1993 in the journal Arch&eacute;ologie du Midi M&eacute;di&eacute;val. Subsequent publication of various sites in the region has reinforced the conclusions of that work and has also added important new details for chronology and classification.</p><p>Although several important architectural features dating to this period have been excavated at Psalmodi, relatively little pottery has been found. Stratified contexts of this period are limited and generally contain few finds. It is not clear to what degree this is the result of a limited material assemblage and to what degree it reflects the use of other, unexcavated parts of the site for trash deposition.</p>

The evidence can be interpreted as corroborating the picture of Psalmodi's economic decline in the late Middle Ages. Although regional ceramics are abundant, imports are scarce compared to many other sites.</p>

These deposits provide a wealth of evidence for changing patterns of ceramic use as rural southern France became incorporated into the modern world-economy between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. It is interesting to note that, despite the importance of Dutch and English trade in the Mediterranean during the 17th to 19th centuries, the major ceramic wares of the early modern Atlantic economy - delftwares, Rhenish stonewares, English creamwares and pearlwares - are absent from this assemblage. Instead, the assemblage appears to consist almost entirely of regional products, with a few Italian imports. The assemblage shows the development of a rural domestic assemblage through the modern era into the middle of the twentieth century, as the functions of ceramics became more limited and therefore also more specialized.</p><table border="0"><tr> <td><a href="images/PS83/PS83.070.088d.jpg"><img src="images/PS83/PS83.070.088dsmall.jpg" border="2"></a></td> <td>Light kaolinitic plate with yellow interior and green exterior, 17th-19th century.</td> </tr><tr> <td><a href="images/PS01/PS01.UCAT.001.jpg"><img src="images/PS01/PS01.UCAT.001small.jpg" border="2"></a></td> <td>Slip-decorated redware plate, 18th century?</td> </tr>
