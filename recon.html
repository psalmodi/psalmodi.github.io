<h3>A Twelfth Century Column and Capital?</h3>
<img src="images/PSNAMED/12thcolsm.gif" align="right" width="124" height="443">
<p>This capital (PS87.096.001), abacus block, and column with attached base (PS87.096.002) are joined in a
hypothetical reconstruction by their dimensions. The drawing at right shows each component at the same scale.  While
it is unlikely that these three particular pieces were ever joined <i>in situ</i>, when shown together now they may
provide evidence for the appearance of a twelfth century cloister.</p>
