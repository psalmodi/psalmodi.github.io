<div class="p">Excavations in a small area immediately to the northeast of the early church produced a large quantity of pottery from Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages. These deposits constitute a complex sequence of features and fills dating between the fifth century AD and the construction of the large church in the late twelfth century. The entire area was then sealed under the floor of the large church. Most of the pottery found in this area appears to be domestic refuse from the fifth and sixth centuries, with relatively minor quantities from the following centuries, when this area was used for burials.</div>
